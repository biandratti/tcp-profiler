## Introduction

This project was built to provide an easy-to-use, web-based interface for testing and profiling TCP, HTTP and TLS connections using the [huginn-net](https://github.com/biandratti/huginn-net) library. The motivation behind this project is to enable researchers, network engineers, and enthusiasts to analyze  connection characteristics in real time, without the need for complex command-line tools or manual packet analysis.

By exposing the huginn-net library through a simple web application, users can:
- Instantly view detailed TCP, HTTP and TLS connection profiles for their own or specified IP addresses.
- Experiment with different network scenarios and observe how signatures and metadata change.
- Use the tool for demonstrations, or diagnostics in real-world environments.

This project aims to make advanced profiling accessible and interactive, helping users better understand network behaviors and improve their own tools or research.

## Modules

### huginn-core
Core library for traffic analysis and fingerprinting.
- Clean data structures for TCP, HTTP, and TLS analysis
- Event system for real-time notifications
- Configurable analyzer with quality thresholds
- Error handling with thiserror integration

### huginn-collector
Network traffic collector that bridges huginn-net with huginn-core.
- Real-time network traffic collection
- Async/sync channel bridging
- Profile caching and merging
- Graceful shutdown handling
```
huginn-net (blocking) → ChannelBridge (thread) → ProfileProcessor (async) → huginn-core
```

### huginn-api
Web API server with REST endpoints and WebSocket support.
- Complete REST API for profile management
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- CORS support for web applications
- Static file serving
- Integrated network collection

## System Requirements

- Rust 1.80 or higher
- libpcap development libraries (use your system's package manager)
- Network interface access (requires root/sudo privileges)

## Quick Start

### 1. Build All Modules
```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

### 2. Run Web Application
```bash
# Build the release version
cargo build --release

# Find your network interface (optional)
ip link show

# Run with default port 3000
`sudo ./target/release/huginn-net-profiler --interface` eth0

# Note: TLS support coming soon
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or your custom port)
- The web interface will show real-time network traffic analysis
- Replace `eth0` with your network interface name (use `ip link show` to list interfaces)
